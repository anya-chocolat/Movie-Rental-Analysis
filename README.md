# Movie Rental Analysis

## Overview
Movie Rental Analysis is a comprehensive analysis project that delves into a movie rental database to extract valuable insights about film categories, actor popularity, store performance, and customer payment trends. Through a combination of SQL queries, data visualization techniques, and insightful reporting, this project aims to provide a deep understanding of various aspects of the film rental business.

You can access the full report [here](report.pdf).

## Features
- **SQL Queries**: Extract relevant data from the movie rental database using SQL queries to perform analyses on actors, films, rentals, and customer payments.
- **Visualization**: Utilize Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly Express to create visual representations of the data, offering clear insights and comparisons.
- **Report**: Present findings and insights in a structured report format, incorporating both textual descriptions and graphical representations for easy understanding.

## Parts of the Project
1. **SQL Queries**: Perform complex analyses using SQL queries to answer key questions about actors, film categories, store performance, and customer payments.
2. **Visualization**: Create visually appealing graphs and charts to showcase the results of the SQL queries, providing intuitive insights into the data.
3. **Report**: Compile all findings and analyses into a comprehensive report, offering detailed explanations and interpretations of the results.
